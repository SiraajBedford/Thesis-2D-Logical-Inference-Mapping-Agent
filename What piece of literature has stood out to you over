The first 'exploratory' interview I attended was very general and more about me than the company. The interviewer wanted to know if I was the right fit for the company and asked about my background and education as well as my general interests. I was told my personality suited the company but I did not have enough experience for the position. They are great with feedback.

Interview process was multiple rounds of in person interviews, with a panel interview and a final interview with the CEO. The interview process was culture focussed and not skills or aptitude focussed.
