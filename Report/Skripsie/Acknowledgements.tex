\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to convey the utmost gratitude and repect to my parents Armina and Ebrahim who are always there for me whenever I need help or advice. I would also like to thank my grandfather Yusuf and aunt Ruqueyah who helped and encouraged me through my high and low moments during my Bachelors studies over these four years. I could not possibly have better people to support me.

A special thanks goes to Dr. van Daalen who provided invaluable guidance and key insight before and during this project's development with respect to the implemented concepts therein and as well as for the effort he put in when reviewing my writing.
