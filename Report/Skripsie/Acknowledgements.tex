\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my parents, grandfather and aunt who helped me through thick and thin during my studies over these 4 years. I could not possibly have better people to support me.

A special thanks goes to Dr. van Daalen who provided valuable guidance and insight during this project with respects to the implemented concepts their-in and also for increasing my interest in AI.
