\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my parents, grandfather and aunt who helped and encouraged me through thick and thin during my Bachelor's studies over these four years. I could not possibly have better people to support me.

A special thanks goes to Dr. van Daalen who provided irreplaceable guidance and key insight before and during this project's development with respects to the implemented concepts their-in and also for increasing my interest in AI.
