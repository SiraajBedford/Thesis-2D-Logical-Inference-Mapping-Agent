\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my parents, Armina and Ebrahim Bedford, as well as my grandfather Yusuf Fredericks and aunt Ruqueyah Yassiem who helped and encouraged me through the thick and thin moments during my Bachelors studies over these four years. I could not possibly have better people to support me.

A special thanks goes to Dr. van Daalen who provided invaluable guidance and key insight before and during this project's development with respects to the implemented concepts therein, as well as for increasing my interest in the field of artificial intelligence.
