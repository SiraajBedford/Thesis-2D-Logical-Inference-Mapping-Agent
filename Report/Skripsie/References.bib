abstract="Let K be a Knowledge Base (KB) and let {\$}{\$}{\backslash}phi {\$}{\$}be a query, the entailment problem {\$}{\$}K {\backslash}models {\backslash}phi {\$}{\$}is crucial for solving the Belief Revision problem. The Belief Revision problem consists in incorporate new beliefs into knowledge base already established, changing as little as possible the original beliefs and maintaining consistency of the KB. A widely accepted framework for reasoning through intelligent systems is the knowledge-based system approach. The general idea is to keep the knowledge in some representative language with a well-defined connotation, particularly it we will be used prepositional logic for modelling the knowledge base and the new information.",
