% Chapter 5: Results

% 5.1 Just give the raw results with no explinatiom. They must instinctively meet up with your objectives though

% Give figures and tables and text

% Must have captions

% For each figure in the text, 
% In figure {x}, we are looking/observing (at) {y} when we do {z}
% What do you observe wrt to the what you expected.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Maze size vs total inference time to map entire map 
\item KB size vs inference time for different algorithms
\item Any others?
\end{enumerate}
