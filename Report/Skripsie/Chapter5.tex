% Chapter 5: Results

% 5.1 Just give the raw results with no explinatiom. They must instinctively meet up with your objectives though

% Give figures and tables and text

% Must have captions

% For each figure in the text, 
% In figure {x}, we are looking/observing (at) {y} when we do {z}
% What do you observe wrt to the what you expected.

\section{Results}


\subsection{Infernce Time for Percepts and Actions Acquisition}




\subsection{Knowledge Base and State Diagram Inspection}




\subsection{Average Iterations to Fully Represent the Environment}


\subsection{Inference Time for Identifying Agent State from Environment Representation for different Environment sizes} 



\subsection{Agent State Prediction}



\section{Discussion of Results}




%Ways to test: Numerically and Diagrammatically

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Maze size vs total inference time to map entire map 
%\item KB size vs inference time for different algorithms
%\item Any others?
%\end{enumerate}
