I would like to thank my parents, grandfather and aunt who helped me thorugh thick and thin during my studies over these 4 tough years. I could not possibly have better fqmily.

A special thanks goes to Dr. van Daalen who provided valuable guidance for this project as well as increasing my interest in AI, not only through the content covered in this project but also in AGI.
