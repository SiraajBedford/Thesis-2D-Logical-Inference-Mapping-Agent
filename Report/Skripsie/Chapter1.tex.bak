\section{Background}

Young children discover how the world works mostly through experience, despite not initially knowing the meaning of what they see, hear, feel, etc. The goal of this project is to do this, but for a simulated agent in a simple block‐world environment. The agent observes the blocks surrounding it as it moves through the environment, but it does not know anything about the world, where the observations come from, or what they mean. The agent should discover the structure of the environment (i.e. learn a map of the environment) from these observations using only general operations such as comparisons and logical operations.
