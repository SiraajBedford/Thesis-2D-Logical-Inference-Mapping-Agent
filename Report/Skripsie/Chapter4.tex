% System Diagram with functional blocks 

% 4.1 Detailed design of component 1
% I chose to use a Mongo database instead of {x,y,z} because of ...
% List technical details

% 4.2 Detailed design of component 2

%In my case this will be code design like in E-Design.
%Mirror the functional blocks.
%In depth calculations or mathematical representation.
