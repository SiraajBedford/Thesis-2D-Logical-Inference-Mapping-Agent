    Outcome & Chapters & Description \\ \hline \hline
    
    ELO 1. Problem solving: Identify, formulate, analyse and solve complex 	engineering problems creatively and innovatively. & 1,3,4,5 & Problem was identified, formulated and analysed in chapters 1 and 3 and solved in chapters 4 and 5. \\ \hline
    
    
    ELO 2. Application of scientific and engineering knowledge: Apply knowledge of mathematics, natural sciences,
engineering fundamentals and an engineering speciality to solve complex engineering problems. & 4 & In-depth system design required mathematical and computer science knowledge to be applied. \\ \hline
    
    
    ELO 3. Engineering Design: Perform creative, procedural and non‐procedural design and synthesis of components, systems, engineering works, products or processes. & 3, 4 & Procedural and non‐procedural design synthesis was required in chapters 3 and 4. \\ \hline



    ELO 4. Investigations, experiments and data analysis: Demonstrate competence to design and conduct investigations and experiments & 5 & Results are given in text, figures and tables with labels and the discussion interprets results.  \\  \hline


    ELO 5. Engineering methods, skills and tools, including Information Technology: Demonstrate competence to use appropriate engineering methods, skills and tools, including those based on information technology. & 4 & The in-depth design used the appropriate skills and tools to solve the problem. \\  \hline



	ELO 6. Professional and technical communication: Demonstrate competence to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with engineering audiences and the community at large. & 1,2,3,4,5,6 &  Communication in writing in all chapters through mathematical and logical reasoning.\\  \hline




    ELO 8. Individual work: Demonstrate competence to work effectively as an individual & 3, 4 & Overall system design in Chapter 3 and detailed design of sub-systems in Chapter 4. \\  \hline



    ELO 9. Independent Learning Ability: Demonstrate competence to engage in independent learning through well‐developed learning skills. & 2 &  Literature study explains various mathematical and computer science related concepts.\\  \hline
