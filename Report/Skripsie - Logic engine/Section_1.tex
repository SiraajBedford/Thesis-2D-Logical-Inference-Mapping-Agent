\section*{Propositional logic engine design}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Encode letters ($\mathcal{P, Q, R, S, T, U, V}$) to propositions.
	\item Must be able to perform logical operations with the propositions.
	\item ($\mathcal{P, Q, R, S, T, U, V}$) is a frame for a possible world.
	\item Possible worlds represent $2^n$, $n=7$ worlds with all possible combinations of True/False values for the propositions.
	\item Able to produce truth table given the Propositional letters.
	\item \textbf{Must} be able to access rows.
	\item Given propositional symbols can encode the propositions into an expression like $\neg P \vee Q$
\end{itemize}
